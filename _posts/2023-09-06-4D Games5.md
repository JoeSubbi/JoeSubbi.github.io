<p style="text-align: justify">
As mentioned at the end of my last update, I have spent a whole bunch of time focussing on Steam and getting everything ready from the publishing perspective. This involved putting together a whole bunch of branding artwork, the trailer and setting up the rest of the Steam Store page.
</p>

On top of that I have also been doing a whole bunch of other work!
 - Integrating Steam Achievements,
 - Developing a Node-based shape editor where you can combine some 4D primitives into custom 4D objects,
 - Adding Wireframes to the Playground modes,
 - Adding Shape Scaling options to the 4D Playground,
 - And lots of gradual improvements to the UI.

## Steam Store Page

<p style="text-align: justify">
The Steam Store page for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2264190/4D_Games/">4D Games</a> is now live!! Make sure to Wishlist the game and keep an eye out for it's release date!
</p>

### New Logo!

<p style="text-align: justify">
Let's be honest. The old logo was not good. This new one however I think captures the retro vibe I like, but also has a nice clean twist to it that I think goes very well with the style of the game!
</p>

### Steam Assets

<p style="text-align: justify">
This isn't all of it, but here are a few of the assets I had to put together for the Steam Store!
</p>

## Steam Achievements

<p style="text-align: justify">
For those of you who enjoy a bit of a challenge, 4D Games now has a set of achievements. The Icons were fun to work on but beware, some of these challenges are much harder than others; Good Luck!
</p>

## 4D Node Editor

<p style="text-align: justify">
As the shapes are rendered using ray marching, I was originally intending to create a code editor similar <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shader Toy</a>. However, I didn't want to scare off any non code folk. Whilst this may be slightly more limiting in terms of what you will be able to make, I think a node based system is much more intuitive.

## Scalable Shapes and Wireframes

<p style="text-align: justify">
The playground mode wasn't much of a playground before now. Now you can modify the dimensions of each shape. For a cube this would be 4 values for the length of the cube in each of the 4 dimensions. For the 3-Torus, there are 3 values for each of it's radii. For the Tiger there are 3 values, 2 for each radii of the DuoCylinder, and 1 for the thickness of the edge that defines the Tiger.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Furthermore, Wireframes were added to the playground modes! The wireframe is a projection of all the edges of a shape onto a 3D plane. You can think of this like setting all the w components of each vertex of a shape to 0. There is slightly more involved when it comes to the more organic shapes like the Cone, but you will have to see that for yourself!

## Chess Piece Destruction

<p style="text-align: justify">
Finally taken chess pieces don't just disappear anymore! Now chess pieces break apart and even in the direction they were taken from! Now I just need some sound effects...
</p>

## New UI

<p style="text-align: justify">
As always, the UI still needs some refinement, but overall I am pretty happy with the frosted glass aesthetic now in place.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Alongside that I have been working on new UI elements such as sliders, toggles, option carousels etc. The game is starting to feel much more cohesive in terms of the user experience!

## 4D Chess in 2D

<p style="text-align: justify">
As if 4D Chess wasn't already complicated enough... I figured for the more competitive players, having to reorient the camera to select the right pieces may be frustrating due to the wasted time. As a solution, I tried flattening the entire board into a 2D space. Whilst this isn't quite as intuitive for myself, I am sure the ability to make moves much faster will be valuable to some.

## Bonus: Experiments into Exporting 3D Printing Files...

<p style="text-align: justify">
Now I am not promising this will be in the game. If it is, it may come after launch. But I have started looking into exporting arbitrary 3D cross sections of the shapes in the playground mode as 3D .stl files for 3D printing. I will make updates as and when I can iron out the current problems!

## Next Time...

<p style="text-align: justify">
A lot of what is to come next is optimisation, artistic improvements and boring stuff like localisation. There may be enough interesting stuff for one more update, but to be honest I am very excited to be coming towards the end of development and almost ready to release!
