This video covers the basics of 4D geometry. How to visualise it through a 3D cross section, and the behaviour of rotations in 4D. 
The tutorial was designed for participants of an experiment run for my final year university dissertation, evaluating extensions to the 3D cross section of 4D geometry. You can check out the final dissertation, and the results of the experiments on my <a href="{{ '/projects/Final-Year-Dissertation/' | absolute_url }}" >dissertation project page</a>.
