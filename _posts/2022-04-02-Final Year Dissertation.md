title: Final Year Dissertation: Developing 4D Geometry
description: Developing and Evaluating Extensions to the 3D Cross Section of 4D Geometry

For my final year at university I embarked on a year long project focussing on the development of a four dimensional renderer.
The project is an investigation and evaluation into extensions to the 3D cross section of 4D geometry.
