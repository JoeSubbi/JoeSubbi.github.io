<h2 style="text-align: justify">
 Developing and Evaluating Extensions to the 3D Cross Section of 4D Geometry
</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">
For my final year at university I embarked on a year long project focussing on the development of a four dimensional renderer written in Unity.
The project was an investigation and evaluation into representing geometry through extensions to the 3D cross section.

During the course of the project I built and rendered a series of 4D primitive shapes using ray marching. I developed a system to freely rotate these shapes without a risk of gimbal lock; and I built a series of extensions to the 3D cross section, each emphasising an aspect of geometry. I evaluated each extensions effectiveness at assisting users in interpreting the surface geometry, understanding a shapes rotation, and assisting users in manipulating this geometry.

The dissertation discusses other literature (Chapter 2) and the results of the evaluation (Chapter 6). The project is summarised in the appendix and conclusion.
