## Rotation Matrices: Problems with Rotation

<p style="text-align: justify">
Rotating a vector in 2D is pretty straightforward. To rotate a 2D vector, \(v_{xy}\), by an angle, \(\theta\), can be accomplished using the following 2D rotation matrix; where \(v'_{xy}\) is the rotated vector:
</p>

$$ v'_{xy} = v_{xy} \begin{bmatrix}
cos\theta & -sin\theta\\
sin\theta & cos\theta\\
\end{bmatrix} $$

<p style="text-align: justify">
If we extend this to higher dimensions, we run into a problem. Euler rotations are non-commutative. Each plane of rotation is applied in turn. As each rotation is applied one after another, two planes of rotation can align themselves parallel to one another. This results in a degree of rotation being lost. This is known as gimbal lock.
I would recommend watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc8b2Jo7mno">video</a> for a more detailed explanation.

## Quaternions: Limitations of Axial Rotations

<p style="text-align: justify">
In 3D we avoid gimbal lock by applying a single rotation, defined by a single axis. A quaternion is defined by 3 components: The \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) vector components that define axis of rotation, and \(w\), which essentially defines the axis of rotation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
In 3D quaternions work really well. However, quaternions <i>only</i> work in 3D. To understand why, consider a 2D square lying in the \(xy\) plane. Generally, if we were to rotate this, we would consider a rotation about the \(z\) axis. But this makes no sense... why would we leave the dimensions we are in to rotate the object. It makes much more sense to consider a rotation about the \(xy\) plane. This becomes a problem in higher dimensions, i.e 4D, where there are 6 planes of rotation, which cannot be defined by axial rotations.

## The Rotor: Rotations About a Plane

The rotor is an entity from geometric algebra. It is very similar to the quaternion, but rather that considering a rotation about an axis, it considers a rotation about a plane.
